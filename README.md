### Description

This is an exploratory analysis of a dataset from Kaggle. In this analysis, I hypothesize a positive correlation between Player Engagement and Player Purchases. So, as players spend more time playing, the more likely they are to spend money.

### Analysis

I use correlation analysis, percentages and ratios of various features (such as age, gender and player statistics).

### Visuals

I use a variety of visualizations including bar and histogram.

### Hypothesis Testing
I use `stats.pearsonr()` to determine the p-value and correlation coefficient
